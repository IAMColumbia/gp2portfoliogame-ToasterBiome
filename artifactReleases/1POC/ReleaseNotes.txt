Release Notes version 1 POC

BattleGame is an epic battle game where you fight a goblin
You can either attack or use one of your four special abilities
The game ends when you kill the goblin
The goblin is a loser and only does regular attacks because it is sad
It also processes the goblins turn very fast because I don't have timing

-Five whole different attacks to choose from
-Goblin to fight
-The screen is really big
-God Unity's UI sucks

The game is very Unity heavy. The Battlesystem uses quite a lot of IEnumerators because of timing issues and not really knowing how to code it. Lots of coroutines that are needed. The maps are loaded from Resources, and they are Unity Tilemaps so they are also Unity dependent. Battlers and Items are both ScriptableObjects which are also Unity specific. It's hard to code yourself out of Unity exclusiveness because Unity boxes you into doing things specific ways and makes them REALLY easy to use. The Unity UI is garbage and caused a lot of problems mangaging it's state, I still have a lot to learn when it comes to that.
